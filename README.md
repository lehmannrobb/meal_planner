## Todos
- Build up seperate user portfolio page
- Add social network functionality (i.e.: the ability to add other users as friends and message them to share recipes and such)

## Run
Clone the repository, then...
```bash
# Install backend dependencies
$ npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
$ cd frontend
$ npm install

# Run both backend/frontend with concurrently
$ npm run dev
```

## Use
Click on the Register button and fill out the form to create a user account. Then add meals by clicking on the 'Add Meal' button and add the recipe for the meal if you choose to.

## Note
Customized from of a course project with Traversy Media to further my learning of the MERN stack. I customized it as a meal planner, rebuilt the UI, components, schema, and added update functionality to the UI.
